# Chatbot

This chatbot is for the academia sector to help students ask course related questions and escalate problems accordingly.

This uses Piazza and wikipidia API to pull information from specific classes and provide answers accordingly.

There is also a semantic similarity and student mood indicator to populate databases with information that can be used by instructors to improve courses.

The bot also takes feedback and stores them into an array and prints them in the end to show counters for negative and positive feedback.
